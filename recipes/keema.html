    <h4>Steps to make chicken keema</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>chicken keema:</strong> 
            Mix the chicken keema minced meat together with the tomato puree and tomato paste in a bowl. Let it sit and soak in the tomatoes while you prepare the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Sizzle whole spices</strong>
            Add cooking oil to a pan on medium heat. Add the whole spices and let them sizzle for a little.</li>
        <li><strong>Onions + green chilies:</strong>
            Add in the onions and green chilies. Fry till onions turn translucent.</li>
        <li><strong>Ginger paste:</strong>
            Add in the ginger paste. We want to fry till the raw ginger smell dissipates.</li>
        <li><strong>Garam masala, red chili powder and mint leaves:</strong>
            Add in the garam masala, red chili powder and mint leaves, and fry till the raw smell disappears. The color of the onion and spices should start to turn dark.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove mixture:</strong>
            We will now remove the mixture into a plate so that we can reuse the pan for the chicken keema.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinated chicken keema, bay leaves, salt and turmeric powder:</strong>
            Add the bay leaves first, then chicken keema. Sprinkle salt and turmeric powder. Cover and cook the meat over low heat until it is soft. Sprinkle water if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Add back onion mixture:</strong>
            Add back the previous mixture into the pan. Stir and cook over low heat until everything is mixed well.</li>
        <li><strong>Coriander leaves:</strong>
            Add the chopped coriander leaves and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li><em><strong>For gravy or curry version:</strong>
            Add 1/2 cup of coconut milk and pour it into the pan. Cook till the curry thickens.</em></li>
    </ol>
